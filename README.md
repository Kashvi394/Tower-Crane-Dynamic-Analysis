# Tower-Crane-Dynamic-Analysis
A self-initiated academic project exploring the dynamic behaviour of construction tower cranes  focusing on payload swing behaviour, slewing motion of the jib, and natural frequencies through physical modelling and MATLAB-based simulation.

## Overview
This project investigates the essential dynamic characteristics of a construction tower crane, focusing on slewing and hoisting operations with a suspended payload. It involves developing a simplified physical model, deriving the nonlinear equations of motion using Lagrange’s method, and implementing MATLAB simulations to study payload swing, natural frequencies, rope tension variation, and system stability. The project also includes modal verification of the crane structure through 2D finite-element analysis.

## Tools Used
- Fusion 360 (CAD modeling)
- MATLAB (numerical simulation)
- ANSYS Workbench (2D modal analysis and validation)
